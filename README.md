Source code modified from the original DOOM 3 for the Doom Reborn mod

To build, just use the included visual studio solution.

You will need a copy of Doom 3 and the assets for the Doom Reborn mod

## Enabling Parallax Occlusion Mapping

Parallax Occlusion Mapping is disabled by default.

To enable it again use `image_usecompression` console command passing 1 or 0 to enable/disable, 
then use  `vid_restart` to update.

The screen will go black then come back grey for a few seconds while it reloads, don't worry that's normal.
